# Slots game
web based slots-game. trello board : https://trello.com/b/rkAdVb6y/slots

# Tools used

1.Vanilla JS
2.HTML
3.CSS

# How I made this Application

1. I designed it on figma when I couldn't find an already designed game. Take a look : Design https://www.figma.com/file/A3LN0cbBzcXIw4cDoeerdw/Untitled

2. I broke done the tasks using a trello board : https://trello.com/b/rkAdVb6y/slots

3. I then proceeded by first making a prototype. The prototype was just to make the slots change and to check if they match

4. After the prototype was made I continued by reskinning my existing prototype, to first resemble my design

# Features to look out for 

1. When the line arrows are clicked you increase your lines bet

2. audio mute and unmute
 
3. win effect


# How to navigate the source code.

1.The code is commented to indicate what each block of code does. I also think my variables are aptly named to improve readablilty.

2.Do give the app a run to see what functionality it has.

3.My favorite part of the project was the spin function. I used a loop to make each colum stop independently. It also calls the checkResulst function after the last colum has moved, stop the spin sound and resets it's time.

4.The checkResults function was also challenging, I used alot of if statements and would like to know about other methods to do something similar.

# Duration of the project 

it took me 2 weeks to design and developed this project

# What would I do different

1. I reshearched slots mechanics but decided to use math.random just beacause it made winning easier, which in return makes debuggin alot easier, but if this project was not just for me I would've tried and made an algorithm

2. Build for mobile first for a cleaner mobile look.
